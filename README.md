# CS-250
CS 250 Final Project

Sprint Review and Retrospective
The SNHU project has turned into a grand project. There have been a lot of snags we have overcome. The waterfall method has been our go to in the past, but as you can see, we have accomplished our goals using the agile method on this project. This has been a new experiment for us to determine if the agile method has been more helpful in our company when compared to the waterfall method. 
SDLC stands for the software development lifecycle (Cobb, 2015). The software development lifecycle includes the following steps: requirements gathering, requirements analysis, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance (Cobb, 2015). The software development lifecycle keeps everyone on a software development project organized. This created stages and plans for every team member to go by. It gives everyone goals to plan their weeks by and creates reachable sprint deliverables. 
When we used the waterfall method, we ran into some snags. We worked on one section and then worked in simple succession after that, right? We didn’t skip around, we had everything planned out from the very beginning. It was definitely a easily replicated process. We worked on one portion of the project at a time. What we found out was that very large projects, like the SNHU travel project, got very confusing with this methodology. The project can just be so very large, that we can’t possibly know exactly what will happen at the very beginning. What if something arises? What if things change beyond our control? This is what we ran into. We had to change course and it really messed things up. Therefore, we have tried the Agile methodology for the SNHU travel project. So, during this project, we decided to take a completely different approach. We did not plan on knowing everything at the beginning. We decided to break everything up and allow for the unknown. We changed our plan multiple times and rolled with the punches. We continued to test constantly as we went along and looked for ways that could improve our process along the way. We did notice that our client got a little irritated, right? Our clients aren’t used to waiting for their finished project as we can see happened in this case. When we constantly change things as we go along it is difficult to give our client an ultimate answer throughout the process. They were quite confused as to why it was taking so long, and they felt like it took way too long to have a decision made on the ultimate cost of the project. Taking too long completing a project and not knowing how much it will ultimately cost the client, is con to using the agile process (Cobb, 2015). This is something we simply had to try out to ultimately know. We may be able to expand on this in the future and come up with some ways we can assure our clients throughout the process. 
Each team member in this lifecycle plays their own important roles. No one team member’s role is any more important than the others because they each can’t finish project without each other. The SNHU project needs to encompass multiple roles since it is such a large project. Sprints will need to be organized accordingly. 
The project owner is the customer’s first point of contact for their new project. They first meet the project owner and tell this team member all their ideas. The project owner knows this will change over time, but that is why we are focusing on an agile approach at this time for Chada Tech. The project owner keeps in touch with the scrum master to relay everything the customer requested (Cobb, 2015). Our product owner was the one to ultimately deliver the final project. 
The scrum master is just as important. The scrum master stays in touch with both the project owner and the development team to keep everyone on the same page. The scrum master is going to take every change in the customers’ requests and bring that to the development team to then make some sprint goals. The scrum master also understands that the customer will change what they want and that is okay because of the Agile approach we are following at Chada Tech. The scrum master is going to lead the scrum for the development team (Cobb, 2015). This team member keeps everyone on track in scrum and helps them to keep their section short and sweet. The scrum master creates a separate time for any abstract ideas brought up during the scrum to be discussed thoroughly. The scrum master keeps the development team focused on their sprints and helps with organization. 
The development team develops the project and also test it throughout sprints (Cobb, 2015). They absolutely must be on the same page as a team, or the project simply cannot be finished. They review all information with the scrum master and design their plans to reach their sprints. They have to all work together because the project requires so much of them. They in turn bring up any difficulties that arise to the scrum master who then takes them to the project owner. These fluctuations in the project are important in that they will happen, but an agile approach can stand up to any changes thrown its way. The team also has a lead member who will make sure any technical questions get reviewed (Cobb, 2015). The team will escalate to the lead member if any issues arise. 
During this project, we noticed some things that occurred that normally wouldn’t have happened under our previous methods. Our backlog changed quite frequently, didn’t it? We received quite a few new story points from our product owner as the project went along. We rolled with the punches, didn’t we? We changed our stories as requested. It didn’t feel as though we were ever going to finish this project but look at us now. The client was more than excited about the final product because it was exactly as they had requested it (even with so many iterations). Our user stories changed. It felt very uncomfortable and like we were moving backwards but it is exactly what our customer wanted in the end. We added the menu items and drop-down items specifically requested. The client is now able to tell their customers that they can search specifically by trips they have already been on and even customize it by their budget. That is something we would appreciate in this product as a typical consumer, isn’t it? I know I don’t always want to spend more than a certain amount. We gave that to them. 
The agile method was successful in this large SNHU Travel project. It required some uncomfortable things of us, but we ultimately delivered exactly what the customer wanted. We are now going to be recommended to others who need this type of project completed for them, as well. This is a method that we will be using moving forward specifically for large projects, because I as your Project Owner am most concerned with delivering high quality projects instead of hastily completed ones. I am so happy with how SNHU Travel turned out. Great job team! We couldn’t have completed it without all jumping in together.

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To interpret user needs, you really need to lean on your whole team. The project owner hears exactly what the user requests, but it is up to the whole team to interpret this so that it actually becomes the project. Each user story breaks down a small portion of what the user requests int tiny sections that can actually turn into the project over time. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
An agile approach to development is quite advanced when compared to waterfall. Waterfall works for some cases, but there are so many companies that now can benefit from agile. I really admire agile and plan to approach development in this way. It is so flexible and can be molded into any projects - especially when a project is changed in the middle of it. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member is going to seek out the opportunity to help others. They want to do a great job so that others do not have to pick up their slack - they also know how to delegate and not get burnt out. They are able to rely on their team members and know that their team has their back.
